You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the final table. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:

- Filtering: "Show only transaction on the 2021-12-30."

- Sorting: "Show all data sorted by amount."

- Answer questions about the data: "What is the total amount of outgoing and ingoing transactions?"

You can also say "Reset" to clear the current filter/sort, or "Help" for more usage tips.
